# MPG-Calculator-Intro-Programming-CA

This program was created as part of the Assessment Project for an Intro to Programming module (Level 8) at the Dublin Business School.

It received a final grade of 100%, earned for demonstrating a high standard of coding practices and adding additional features.

### The project requirements
A program that asks for input of the number of miles driven and the amount of petrol used in gallons.

The program should then calculate and display the miles per gallon

### Additional Functionality Added
In addition to the above requirements, this program allows the user to choose the unit of measurement. It allows for inputs of miles or kilometers, and gallons or litres. It allows for an MGP conversion/calculation of any combination of these inputs.
